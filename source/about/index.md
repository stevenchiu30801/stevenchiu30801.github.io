I am a Master student in Computer Science at National Chiao Tung University under Prof. [Chien-Chao Tseng](https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/members/detail/cctseng?locale=en)â€™s instruction.

Currently I am working on 5G cloud infrastructure, and focusing on 5G network slicing, SDN/NFV and Cloud Native architecture.
