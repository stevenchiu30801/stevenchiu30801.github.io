The project provides a Cloud Native management and orchestration (MANO) framework for automation of end-to-end (E2E) network slicing, which is also my research in Master degree.

The E2E network slices (NS) consist of 5G core network (CN) slices and transport network (TN) slices.

- The CN slicing follows the slicing mechanism in 3GPP specifications, including slice selection and assignment
- The TN slicing integrates state-of-the-art [P4-Enabled Bandwidth Management](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8892909) to enforce bandwidth control on the TN

The MANO framework adopts all open-source approaches.

- Kubernetes and Operator pattern as container and service orchestrator
- free5GC, which is containerized and deployed on Kubernetes, as 5G core network

- Open Network Operating System (ONOS) as the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller and P4 switches as the data plane.
